### 🧠 About Me

I'm Russ, an automation-first thinker with a mechanical engineering brain and a hacker’s soul.  
I help small businesses, agency owners, and solopreneurs **optimize operations and reclaim time** using AI, APIs, and self-hosted tooling.

Think of me as your **tech whisperer for systems** – whether it's building custom automations, integrating stacks, or deploying secure, self-hosted infrastructure.
